express-idempotency-cache
=========================

Idempotency middleware for [Express](https://expressjs.com) to avoid duplicate requests processing of non-idempotency verbs of HTTP. Like PUT and POST, for example.

Getting started
---------------

Install the dependency.
```bash
npm install express-idempotency-cache --save
```

Integrate the middleware in your Express initialization

```javascript
const idempotency = require('express-idempotency-cache');

const config = {
    adapter: 'redis' // "redis" or "memory"
    redis  : {
        hostname: 'url-to-your-redis-instalation.yourdomain.com',
        port    : 'port for your redis instalation' // optional
    },
    ttl: '86400' // If not specified, default is 24 hours
};

// ...express initialization
app.use(express.json())      // Body configuration SHOULD be declared BEFORE
app.use(express.urlencoded() // Body configuration SHOULD be declared BEFORE

app.use(idempotency.init(idempotencyConfig))
```

Add idempotency config to your routes
```javascript
const idempotency = require('express-idempotency-cache');

app.post('/some-route', idempotency.set(500), function(request, response) {

    // Do your code here...

    // Send response
    response.json(yourResponseHere)
});
```
